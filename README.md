# Android-Track-Location

GEO FENCE
In this project, I have designed and implemented an Android-based tracking app. The project is to build Android based location aware application to keep track of the user’s location using the GPS and then mark the path along the traversal until the tracking is stopped.

Project Description
This Android app uses two basic services of android mobile 
1)	Geo Location Provider using GPS
2)	Marking the position on the map
I have implemented this app using Android Studio and few online material cited below.
App contains two files MapsActivity.java 
•	Contains MapReady function to add then create the map and also enable the map.
•	Default functions for location listener.
•	addMarker and drawPolyline function to achieve the task 2.
•	And other predefined functions.
And GeoFence.java
•	Contains the code for services mentioned above
•	And auxiliary functions which supports the app.
•	Calculate the distance walked from the tracker is started and stopped.
